		<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
		<p>My game is like Frogger where the player is trying to ride the logs to the other side without missing a log and falling into the water.</p>
		<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
		<p>I think I could have put more time into having something happen to the player if he/she missed the log and fell into the water, I could have also added a finishing platform on the other side so that the player knew where to end.</p>

		<img src="game.PNG"/><p>When the player correctly jumps onto the log the player will ride the log till he/she jumps to the next one.</p>
		<img src="game2.PNG" /><p>The player starts at the bottom of the screen till he/she can jump onto the first log.</p>
		<img src="Capture.PNG"/><p>This bit of code is checking whether or not the player is on a log or not.</p>
